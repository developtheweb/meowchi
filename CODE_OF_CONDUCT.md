# 🧘‍♂️ Code of Conduct — Meowchi Project

Welcome to Meowchi—a realm of productivity, polymathy, and pixelated paw punches.

We expect all contributors, testers, and chaos engineers to abide by the following tenets:

## ☯️ Core Principles

- **Be intellectually honest.**  
  No cargo cult code. If you don't understand what you're doing, admit it and let's solve it together.

- **Be courteous to all lifeforms.**  
  That includes contributors, maintainers, and yes—your virtual cat.

- **Respect the chaos.**  
  Meowchi may be silly, but its codebase is structured. Don't unstructure it casually.

- **Feed your pet.**  
  Or at least your ideas. Don’t ghost the repo unless you’ve evolved.

## 🚫 Unacceptable Behavior

- Personal attacks, gatekeeping, or ego jousting
- Neglecting issues for absurd durations (e.g. >9 Meowchi lives)
- Demanding features without context, contribution, or cookies
- Passive-aggressive pull requests titled “Fixed your mess”

## 🧵 Conflict Resolution

If a thread derails, a commit insults quantum logic, or a contributor attempts to implement a Meowchi DAO without consensus, escalate to:

📬 **conduct@stevenmilanese.com**  
(Or meditate briefly and post a civil comment. Either works.)

This is a place of curiosity, levity, and high-functioning nonsense.  
Act accordingly. 😼
